# caesar-cipher

This program is aimed to encrypt the string entered in the function with the string and shift passed as arguments. 
For each letter of the string from A to Z  or a to z, the letter would shift based on the selected numbers. If the shift
number is positive, eg. 2 and string is "Hello" the result would return "Jfnnq". Whereas, if the string is "Hello" and the shift number 
is a negative number, eg. -2, the result would return "Fcjjm"
